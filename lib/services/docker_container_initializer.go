		This method is used to declare that the service will need a set of files in order to run. To do this, the developer
		declares a set of string keys that are meaningful to the developer, and Kurtosis will create one file per key. These newly-createed
		file objects will then be passed in to the `InitializeMountedFiles` and `GetStartCommand` functions below keyed on the
		strings that the developer passed in, so that the developer can initialize the contents of the files as they please.
		Kurtosis then guarantees that these files will be made available to the service at startup time.

		NOTE: The keys that the developer returns here are ONLY used for developer identification purposes; the actual
		filenames and filepaths of the file are implementation details handled by Kurtosis!

		Args:
			mountedFileFilepaths: Mapping of developer_key -> initialized_file_filepath where developer_key corresponds to the keys returned
				in the `GetFilesToMount` function, and initialized_file_filepath is the path *on the Docker container* of where the
				file has been mounted. The files will have already been initialized via the `InitializeMountedFiles` function.

				address of the container should use this placeholder string when they want the IP. This will get replaced at
				service launch time with the actual IP.

				running the service. If this is nil, then no explicit command will be specified and whatever command the Dockerfile
				specifies will be run instead.
