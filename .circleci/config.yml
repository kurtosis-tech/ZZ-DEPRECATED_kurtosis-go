      # DO NOT USE THIS YET! This costs 200 credits *per job run* so is extremely expensive for the free plan, but we can turn it on one day if we get more credits
      # docker_layer_caching: true

# NOTE: Because CircleCI jobs run on separate machines from each other, we duplicate steps (like checkout) between jobs. This is because doing the "correct" DRY
#  refactoring of, "one job for checkout, one job for build Docker image, etc." would require a) persisting files between jobs and b) persisting Docker images between
#  jobs. Both are annoying (saving/loading workspaces require re-downloading the workspace over the network, and there doesn't seem to be a good way to do Docker
#  images), so we run everything inside a single job.

      # NOTE: Commented out this hacky way of preventing builds if not a PR because it might be premature optimization
      # # Frustratingly, CircleCI doesn't have a pipeline value indicating pull requests so we can't use a "when" condition to make sure we don't even run this
      # #  job since the "when" condition is evaluated at configuration time and the environment variables like CIRCLE_PULL_REQUEST are only injected at runtime
      # #  after spinning up the VM (meaning for all non-PR commits, we're going to waste time spinning up the VM only to abort)
      # - run: |
      #     if [ -z "$CIRCLE_PULL_REQUEST"]; then

      # Gotchas I discovered when writing this:
      # - Without the '--no-pager' flag, Git will print "WARNING: Terminal is not fully functional" and not display any output
      # - Circle has no way of getting the PR base branch, so we have to hardcode develop :( See: https://ideas.circleci.com/cloud-feature-requests/p/provide-env-variable-for-branch-name-targeted-by-pull-request
      # - The --exit-code flag to git-diff returns 0 on no changes, 1 on changes
      # - We have to use 'origin/develop' rather than 'develop' because Circle does a shallow checkout, and 'develop' gets set to something weird and wrong that makes the check buggy
